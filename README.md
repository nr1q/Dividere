# Letterming
This library is inspired on [Lettering.js](https://github.com/davatron5000/Lettering.js) and [charming.](https://github.com/yuanqing/charming)

## Why another library for this purpose?
Because I wish to have an enhanced behaviour of Lettering.js, but without losing the new lines on the input text as it happens with charming; plus other stuff like input trimming to fix counter on the classname.
